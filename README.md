Doubly linked list implementation

There are five files in this repository. I made this implementation object oriented. There are two header files and two cpp files for that header file.
There is one cpp file called main.cpp.
Download all the files and put in single folder and run the main file.
Test my program and tell me if there is any error in it. Its a hard coded program. You can put your own numbers.
